Cocktail Book
=============

A simple cocktail app.

Majority of time spent programming was setting up custom UI elements (as opposed to things like the category filter/etc). Although, I'm not a designer.

####Tools
* Cocoapods
* JASidePanel
* PopoverView
* XCode with iOS 6.1

You may need to use Cocoapods to install the two dependencies (JASidePanel, PopoverView).
